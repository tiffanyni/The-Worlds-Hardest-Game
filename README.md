# This game is a remake of the world's hardest game. 

The objective of the game is to control the red square (using arrow keys) and move it to the green box on the right side. 
If the red square collides with any of the blue boxes, then you respawn at the starting point again. There is a counter on the bottom right corner showing you the number of fails you have accumulated so far. At any point of the game, you can press the backspace key to return to the start menu.

That's it, enjoy!!
